## Overview

A social networking platform designed to connect people by their shared interests and passions.
We understand that having a shared interest is one of the most effective ways to connect with others. That's why we've built a platform that allows users to join groups based on their hobbies, connect with like-minded individuals, and plan events to enjoy their hobbies together. Whether you're into sports, art, music, cooking, gaming, or any other hobby, you'll be able to find a group of people who share your interests and are excited to connect.
